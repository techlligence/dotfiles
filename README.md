# What makes this config special?
I use primarily xmonad, however, I do have a decent bspwm config in my repo that works with polybar and of course sxhkd.

I have two xmonad config files:
One that has xmonad like monitor swapping, it has the following features:
- Dynamic bar setup for multiiple monitors
- Ezconfig implementation
- Correct fullscreen implementation (for hiding xmobar)

The other config simulates the multihead behaviour of dwm. I prefer the above config.
